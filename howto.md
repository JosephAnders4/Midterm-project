How was this site made?
==============================

[Back to Home](https://github.com/JosephAnders4/Midterm-project.git)  

This website was created using Markdown. Markdown is a syntax that allows the creation of rich-formatting documents with plain text and indicates how they should be displayed. Markdown can be converted to HTML and other formats.  

You can also include blocks of code within these files, such as what is displayed below:

    console.log("This is a code block.")
    var two1 = 2
    var two2 = 2
    console.log("Two plus two equals " + str(two1 + two2))
